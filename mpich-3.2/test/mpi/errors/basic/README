This directory contains programs that are expected to fail in some way.  
They should be run manually to check the response of the MPI implementation 
to these failures.

The programs are:

debabort: This is a simple program that passes inconsistent parameters to 
MPI_Allreduce and should cause a run-time error.  This may be used to see
if a debugger can regain control of an MPI program when such an error, which
will normally cause an Abort, occurs.

lefthandles: This program allocates several MPI objects that are not freed.
An MPI implmentation is not required to report this or fail in this case, 
but an MPI implementation that is striving to report storage leaks caused by
user programs should report allocated and unfreed MPI objects.
