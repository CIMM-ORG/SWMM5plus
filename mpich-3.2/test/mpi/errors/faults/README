This directory contains tests for the ability of MPI to survive faults.
The MPI standard permits but does not require that an MPI
implementation continue through a fault.  If the MPI implementation
does (claim) to be fault tolerant, these test programs provide some
basic tests.  To enable these, configure the tests with the configure
option --enable-checkfaults .
