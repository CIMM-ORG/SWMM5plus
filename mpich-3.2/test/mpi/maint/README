This readme describes the plan for generating tests automatically
from the description in the structured comment, along with some 
additional information.  

For each source file:
1. Find the structured comment (/*@)
2. Find the "Input Parameters" entry and read the parameters (lines
   starting with +, . and ending with -; single args use .
3. Find the "Output Parameters" and match types as for input parameters
4. For each input parameter, check the defined values (range) and
   generate test calls.  E.g., for ravalude that should be non-negatiuve
   integers, make a call with a negative value.
5. Use template for the start/end of the test program
