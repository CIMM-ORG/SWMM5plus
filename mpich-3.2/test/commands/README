This directory contains tests for commands that are included with MPICH.
These include tests of commands for compiling and linking MPI programs, 
such as mpicc and mpif77, and for using mpiexec to run MPI programs.
These tests cover both command-line options recommended by the MPI-Forum and
options that are part of the common MPICH extensions for mpiexec.

In addition, the program testout.c can be used to check the buffering of
stdio.  As a quality of implementation issue, users expect programs run
by mpiexec to preserve their buffering choice (or at least the appearence of
it).  This program writes several lines of output with delays between each
line; those delays should be observed when the program is run under mpiexec.
