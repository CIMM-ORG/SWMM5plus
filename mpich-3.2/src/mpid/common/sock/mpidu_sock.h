Notes:
While not a post routine, this routine can generate events.  In fact,
unlike the post routine, many MPIDU_SOCK_OP_ACCEPT events can 
be generated from a listener (typically one per incoming connection attempt).

The implementation may generate an event as soon it is notified that a
new connection is forming.  In such an implementation, 
MPIDU_Sock_accept() may be responsible for finalizing the connection.
It is also possible that the connection may fail to 
complete, causing MPIDU_Sock_accept() to be unable to obtain a sock
despite the event notification. 

The environment variable MPICH_PORT_RANGE=min:max may be used to
restrict the ports mpich processes listen on. 

Thread safety:

MPIDU_Sock_post_write - request that data be written to a sock

Input Parameters:
+ sock - sock object which the data is to be written
. buf - buffer containing the data
. minlen - minimum number of bytes to write
. maxlen - maximum number of bytes to write
+ upate_fn - application progress aupdate function (may be NULL)

Return value: a MPI error code with a Sock extended error class
+ MPI_SUCCESS - request to write was successfully posted
. MPIDU_SOCK_ERR_INIT - Sock module not initialized
. MPIDU_SOCK_ERR_BAD_SOCK - invalid sock object
. MPIDU_SOCK_ERR_BAD_LEN - length parameters must be greater than zero and maxlen must be greater than minlen
. MPIDU_SOCK_ERR_NOMEM - unable to allocate required memory
. MPIDU_SOCK_ERR_INPROGRESS - this operation overlapped with another like operation already in progress
- MPIDU_SOCK_ERR_FAIL - other error attempting to post write

Events generated:
. MPIDU_SOCK_OP_WRITE

Event errors: a MPI error code with a Sock extended error class
+ MPI_SUCCESS -  successfully established
. MPIDU_SOCK_ERR_BAD_BUF - using the buffer described by buf and maxlen resulted in a memory fault
. MPIDU_SOCK_ERR_SOCK_CLOSED - the sock object was closed locally
. MPIDU_SOCK_ERR_CONN_CLOSED - the connection was closed by the peer
. MPIDU_SOCK_ERR_CONN_FAILED - the connection failed
. MPIDU_SOCK_ERR_NOMEM - unable to allocate required memory
- MPIDU_SOCK_ERR_FAIL - other error completing the write

Notes:
Only one write operation may be posted at a time.  Furthermore, an immediate write may not be performed while a posted write is
outstanding.  This is considered to be an application error, and the results of doing so are undefined.  The implementation may
choose to catch the error and return MPIDU_SOCK_ERR_INPROGRESS, but it is not required to do so.

If MPIDU_Sock_post_close() is called before the posted write operation completes, the write operation will be terminated and a
MPIDU_SOCK_OP_WRITE event containing a MPIDU_SOCK_ERR_SOCK_CLOSED error will be generated.  This event will be returned by
