If you want to recompile the code faster:
1. Comment line 9 in Allmake.sh
2. Execute Allmake.sh
3. Comment line 4 in Allmake.sh
4. There should be a new folder called SWMMwrapper, cd SWMMwrapper
5. Open SWMMwrapper/Allmake.sh
6. Comment line 21 in SWMMwrapper/Allmake.sh
6. Execute SWMMwrapper/Allmake.sh
7. Comment lines 3-9
8. cd ../
9. Execute Allmake.sh (no code is downloaded now, compilation takes less time)
